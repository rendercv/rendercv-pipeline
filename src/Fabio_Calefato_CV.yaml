    research_activity:
    - My research primarily focuses on the intersection of Software Engineering and
      AI/ML, while also encompassing human factors in software development and globally
      distributed software engineering. Throughout my career, I have maintained a
      strong focus on empirical validation of research findings, conducting controlled
      experiments, case studies, and mining open-source software repositories. My
      work has consistently appeared in top-tier venues and has influenced both academic
      research and industry practices in software engineering. Below is a detailed
      description of some of my research activities, organized by recency and impact.
    - '**Generative AI for software engineering research and practices**: In collaboration
      with leading international researchers, I am advancing three active workstreams
      that emerged from my participation in the 2023 and 2024 editions of the [*Copenhagen
      Symposium on Human-Centered Software Engineering AI*](https://www.danielrusso.org/copenhagen-symposium-human-centered-ai-software-engineering).
      The first workstream comprises an observational study mining self-admitted mentions
      of LLMs usage in open-source projects. Together, we examined how developers
      integrate AI assistants into their workflows across development tasks, content
      types, and usage purposes. Our study analyzed over 250,000 open-source repositories,
      identifying patterns in AI tool adoption and their impact on project metrics.
      An article describing this collaborative work is currently under review at IEEE
      TSE. The second workstream aims to establish a comprehensive set of guidelines
      for conducting experiments with LLMs in software engineering research. Our joint
      initiative addresses the challenges of achieving reproducible results with LLMs
      by tackling their unique characteristics that affect study validity and reproducibility,
      providing researchers with concrete protocols for empirical evaluations. The
      third workstream investigates the integration of AI in software engineering
      research methodologies. Together, we examine how Generative AI tools can support
      various research tasks including qualitative analysis, systematic literature
      reviews, and human studies design. Our collaborative work explores both opportunities
      and risks of AI adoption in SE research, gathering perspectives from researchers
      about the changing landscape of empirical software engineering methods.'
    - '**Software engineering for AI-enabled systems**: One of my recent research
      interests has focused on improving the development workflows of AI/ML-based
      systems through empirical studies and tool development. I conducted a comprehensive
      review of industry-leading AutoML tools to analyze their benefits and limitations
      in software engineering contexts (IST 2025). I have contributed to understanding
      MLOps practices by analyzing adoption patterns in open-source projects on GitHub
      (ESEM 2022). This work revealed key challenges in transitioning ML models from
      experimentation to production, leading to the development of an MLOps solution
      framework applied in healthcare contexts (CAIN 2022). Finally, I have established
      best practices for collaborative development of AI systems using computational
      notebooks (CSCW 2021).'
    - '**Industry-based research on the state of software engineering practices**:
      I have participated in and continue to contribute to several industry-based
      global surveys to understand software engineering practices. The [*HELENA*](https://helenastudy.wordpress.com/helena-team)
      (Hybrid dEveLopmENt Approaches in software systems development) project has
      identified key characteristics of hybrid development approaches through analysis
      of 1,000+ developers across 50 countries since 2016. Our findings on agile process
      adoption patterns appeared in IEEE TSE (2021), significantly impacting our understanding
      of modern development methodologies. The [*NaPiRE*](http://www.napire.org) project
      (Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering) is a global survey initiative
      examining industrial practices and challenges in Requirements Engineering. Through
      biannual surveys, our large-scale academic collaboration develops a holistic
      theory of RE practices and problems, producing insights that guide problem-driven
      research. The *Evolution of Post-Pandemic Work Policies* project analyzes hybrid
      and remote work policies across companies worldwide through global surveys and
      academic collaboration. Our research provides evidence-based insights into emerging
      work patterns, revealing challenges and adaptations in post-pandemic work environments
      and helping organizations optimize their hybrid workplace policies.'
    - '**Human factors in software engineering**: In my research I have extensively
      investigated how human factors such, as personality traits, emotions, and social
      dynamics, influence software development processes, leveraging AI/ML techniques
      for analysis across various developer platforms and communication channels.
      In technical Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow, I have conducted comprehensive
      studies analyzing both technical aspects (such as community guidelines for effective
      questions) and social factors affecting answer success rates (MSR 2015, ESEM
      2016, IST 2018, EMSE 2019). This work has led to the creation of gold standards
      for sentiment analysis (MSR 2018) and the development of ML-based methods to
      detect emotions and sentiment polarity in technical communication (IEEE Software
      2020). Additionally, I have conducted cross-platform evaluations of sentiment
      analysis tools (MSR 2020) and performed extended replications to assess how
      the choice of sentiment analysis tools influences the validity of empirical
      studies (EMSE 2021). Beyond sentiment analysis, I have investigated how developer
      personalities influence collaboration in large software ecosystems like Apache
      (ICGSE 2018, IST 2019), with particular attention to how traits like agreeableness
      impact code review activities and pull request acceptance (ICGSE 2017). My work
      has shed light on the need for developing specialized tools for automatic personality
      detection from text in technical contexts (TOSEM 2021). With this line of research,
      I have demonstrated the critical importance of domain-specific approaches when
      analyzing developer communications, showing the limitations of general-purpose
      personality and sentiment analysis tools in software engineering contexts. Finally,
      I have also studied retention and disengagement factors of Open Source Software
      community participants, defining and validating a theoretical model of the activity
      rhythm of open-source project developers (SOHEAL 2019, EMSE 2022).'
    - '**Global software engineering**: My research has addressed the challenges of
      software development distributed on a global scale. Key contributions include
      theoretical and empirical work on trust-building mechanisms and social awareness
      in virtual teams (CSCW 2013, CHASE 2012, IEEE Software 2013). I pioneered SocialCDE,
      a social awareness tool for fostering trust in distributed teams (ESEC/FSE 2013),
      which was awarded the *2011 Microsoft Software Engineering Innovation Award*;
      this work demonstrated how social awareness tools can increase trust and improve
      coordination in global teams. I also made significant advances in communication
      barriers, developing and evaluating eConference, a real-time ML-based translation
      tool (ICGSE 2010-11, ESEM 2012, ESEM 2014, ESE 2016) that showed promising efficiency
      gains while identifying important trade-offs in distributed development activities;
      the tool was awarded the *2006 Eclipse Innovation Award* by IBM. Additional
      contributions include an industrial action research study on communication tools
      in distributed agile teams (ICGSE 2020). My expertise in this domain is reflected
      in my service as General Chair for ICGSE 2019 and my role as Guest Editor for
      JSS special issue on Global Software Engineering (JSS 2021).'
